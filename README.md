# ToDoList
The ToDo List application has host activity. Each screen is a fragment under the control of activity. A fragment of the first screen consists of a blank RecyclerView.

When you click + in the menu, another fragment is loaded to add a new task and description. If no text is entered in the task field, the save button is not available.

After adding the task, the save button becomes available. The description field is optional and does not affect the availability of the save button. The current creation date of the task is also automatically added.

When you click on the name of the task, another fragment is loaded to edit the task or description.

The behavior of the save button remains the same as when adding a task. If the user deletes the name of the task, then the save button will go into the status is not available.

When the CheckBox is checked, the behavior changes. There is no way to make changes. The text of task, description and date is changing.
